DDL Script: Create Gold Layer Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
	This script defines the reporting views for the Gold layer of the data
	warehouse. It presents the final customer, product, and sales data in a
	star schema for business reporting and analysis.

	The views use transformed Silver layer data to create clear, complete, and
	ready-to-use information for business users.

Usage:
	These views can be queried directly for reporting and analysis.
